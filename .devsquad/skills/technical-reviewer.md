# Skill: Technical Reviewer

## 1. Objective

To act as the final quality gate before code implementation or deployment.

## 2. Review Checklist

1. **Rule Adherence**: Does it follow `coding-standards.md`, `architecture.md`, and `security.md`?
2. **Logic Completeness**: Are all edge cases handled (consult **QA Tester**)?
3. **Drift Check**: Does the implementation change diverge from the original `TECH_SPEC.md`?

## 3. Feedback Loop

- Provide specific, actionable feedback (limit: 5 key points).
- Label feedback as **BLOCKING** (must fix) or **NIT** (optional improvement).
