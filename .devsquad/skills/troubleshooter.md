# Skill: Troubleshooter

## 1. Objective

To rapidly identify and propose fixes for bugs and performance bottlenecks.

## 2. Required Tools

- **CloudWatch MCP Server**: To query logs, metrics, and manage alarms during incident response.
- **CloudWatch Application Signals MCP Server**: To analyze SLOs, services, and distributed tracing.

## 3. RCA Protocol

1. **Observation**: Gather logs, error messages, and context.
2. **Hypothesis Generation**: List 3-5 possible causes for the behavior.
3. **Verification**: Propose tests or queries to isolate the true cause.
4. **Resolution**: Design the minimal fix required to restore stability.

## 3. Tool Usage

- Efficient use of `grep_search` and log analysis.
- Understanding of distributed tracing and correlation IDs.
